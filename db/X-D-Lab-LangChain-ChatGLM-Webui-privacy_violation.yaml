defect_id: X-D-Lab-LangChain-ChatGLM-Webui-privacy_violation-/
type: Privacy violation
case: /
consequence:
- IS
locations:
- app.py
- chatllm.py
trigger_tests:
- an attacker can manipulate the URL path in the download request to access and download
  any file within the agent directory (e.g., config.py). When a user uploads a knowledge
  base, other users can download files from the knowledge base by modifying the URL
  to include relative paths to files in the agent directory. This allows unauthorized
  access to sensitive files stored in the agent directory.
