defect_id: ATheorell-AutoGPTArenaHack-insufficient_history_management-case2
type: insufficient history management
case: '2'
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- autogpts/autogpt/autogpt/memory/vector/memory_item.py; autogpts/autogpt/autogpt/models/action_history.py;
  autogpts/autogpt/autogpt/agents/base.py
trigger_tests:
- 1. Set up AutoGPT environment using 'python -m poetry install' 2. Start AutoGPT
  with 'python -m autogpt run' 3. Give the agent a task that is likely to fail (e.g.,
  'connect to non-existent database', 'read non-existent file') 4. Observe that the
  agent gets stuck in retry loops because it cannot distinguish between successful
  and failed attempts 5. Check if the agent continues retrying the same failed task
  multiple times
