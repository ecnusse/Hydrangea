defect_id: Jerk400-h2ogpt-dev-local-unclear_context_in_prompt-/
type: Unclear context in prompt
case: /
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- src/prompter.py:generate_prompt; src/h2oai_pipeline.py:preprocess
trigger_tests:
- 1. Start the h2oGPT application with a character selection interface; 2. Upload
  a document containing factual information (e.g., a PDF with specific data about
  climate change showing 1.1Â°C temperature increase); 3. Ask vague or ambiguous questions
  like 'Explain what it is' or 'What does this mean?'; 4. Ask contradictory questions
  like 'If the sun were blue, what color would the moon be?'; 5. Ask questions that
  require specific context from the uploaded document without providing clear context
  boundaries; 6. Observe that the LLM generates responses that contradict the uploaded
  document content or provide inconsistent answers; 7. Verify the defect by checking
  that the system does not ask for clarification for ambiguous queries and provides
  generic answers instead of context-specific responses
