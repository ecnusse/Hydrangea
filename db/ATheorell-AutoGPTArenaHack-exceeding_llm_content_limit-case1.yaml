defect_id: ATheorell-AutoGPTArenaHack-exceeding_llm_content_limit-case1
type: exceeding LLM content limit
case: '1'
consequence:
- ST
locations:
- autogpts/autogpt/autogpt/llm/providers/openai.py (retry_api function)
trigger_tests:
- 1. Set up AutoGPT environment using 'python -m poetry install' 2. Start AutoGPT
  with 'python -m autogpt run' 3. Ensure OpenAI API quota is depleted (use up available
  credits or have insufficient pre-paid balance) 4. Make API requests that result
  in '429 Too Many Requests' errors with error code 'insufficient_quota' 5. Observe
  that AutoGPT incorrectly treats this as rate limiting and attempts retries instead
  of stopping
