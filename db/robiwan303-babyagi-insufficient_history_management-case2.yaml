defect_id: robiwan303-babyagi-insufficient_history_management-case2
type: insufficient history management
case: '2'
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- babyagi.py/task_creation_agent()
trigger_tests:
- '1.Run the script according to the previously mentioned steps.

  2.Observe whether the generated task list becomes increasingly similar to previous ones over time, showing no progress.

  Example:

  High-Quality Tasks (Early Stage)

  Task 2: Plan a Duck Pond Ring Toss game for an interactive and enjoyable activity

  Low-Quality Tasks (Late Stage)

  Task 54: Plan a Picnic in the Park with friends for a relaxing and enjoyable day

  Task 57: Have a Beach Day with friends for a fun and relaxing time

  Early high-quality tasks (e.g., "Duck Pond Ring Toss") have clear activity types
  and specific scenarios; late low-quality tasks (e.g., "park picnic," "Beach Day")
  are vague, lacking key details, and can''t be directly executed.'
