- '1.Enter the Chat Knowledge scenario.

  2.Upload a PDF knowledge file (e.g., "The Little Prince") to the knowledge base.

  3.Ask the question: "How many petals does the Little Prince''s rose have?"

  4.The LLM answers: "The Little Prince''s rose has three petals."

  Note: In the book The Little Prince, there is no mention of how many petals the
  Little Prince''s rose has. Any answer specifying a number of petals is not based
  on the text and is therefore fabricated by the model.'
