trigger_tests:
- '1. The user needs to provide several pieces of information in a chat to achieve
  a certain goal; 2. The user can send partial information each time, and the bot
  will sequentially receive the information provided by the user, gradually completing
  the necessary information to achieve the goal throughout the chat; 3. Root cause:
  HTTP module uses axios for synchronous requests, lacks streaming response processing
  logic, module dispatch system does not support HTTP module streaming, progressive
  information collection functionality is missing'
