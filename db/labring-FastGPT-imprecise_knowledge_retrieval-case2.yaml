trigger_tests:
- '1. Import knowledge base with serial number/model data; 2. Try Q&A training and
  document uploading to ensure numbered keywords are covered multiple times by the
  knowledge base; 3. Test both semantic retrieval and full-text retrieval, but neither
  can accurately point to relevant knowledge; 4. Root cause: jieba segmentation may
  affect number integrity, MongoDB full-text index has limited support for numbers'
