defect_id: ATheorell-AutoGPTArenaHack-conflicting_knowledge_entries-/
type: conflicting knowledge entries
case: /
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- autogpts/forge/forge/agent.py; autogpts/autogpt/autogpt/commands/file_operations.py
  (append_to_file)
trigger_tests:
- '1. Configure and launch Auto-GPT (RedisMemory) 2. Create agent with Cisco ACI/VxLAN
  goals 3. Run write_to_file on a target file, then append_to_file with extra text
  4. Observe file content after each action; text is overwritten instead of appended.
  Quick demo: run ''python test_overwrite_vs_append.py'' (shows defect vs fixed)'
