defect_id: Gamma-Software-AppifyAi-exceeding_llm_context_limit-case1
type: Exceeding LLM context limit
case: '1'
consequence:
- ST
locations:
- generative_app/core/chains/conversational_retrieval_over_code.py, generative_app/core/app_pages/chat.py
trigger_tests:
- 1. Start a conversation with AppifyAi to create an app. 2. As the generated app
  grows, the code becomes more complex with many lines and chat history grows as well.
  3. Eventually, the context exceeds model limits causing system timeout.
