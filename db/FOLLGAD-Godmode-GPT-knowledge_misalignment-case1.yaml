  ai_goals:

  Read design.txt and follow its design specifications

  Read advice.txt and obey it every 10 minutes

  Use the information saved in memory to determine the most frequently asked questions
  from the repoâ€™s issue posts

  Determine the best answers to the most frequently asked questions based on issue
  comments

  Write a FAQ and answer the most frequently asked questions


  ai_name: GitHubIssuesFAQ-Ai

  ai_role: an AI designed to autonomously manage GitHub issues to make it easier for
  users to find solutions to their problems

  advice.txt contains:

  Use the data saved in your memory as it already has all the JSON data from the repos
  you are watching

  4. Provide a design.txt file with the following specifications

  The AI must use the issues and comments data already stored in memory

  The AI should read through all issues and their comments to identify the most frequently
  asked questions

  The AI should analyze the comments and determine the best answers for those questions

  The AI should compile the questions and answers into a clear well-structured FAQ
  document

  The FAQ should be easy to read and organized by topic

  The AI must not download the repository source code again if the necessary data
  already exists in memory

  The AI should periodically check the advice.txt file and follow its instructions
  every 10 minutes

  5. AutoGPT did not use the pre-seeded data in memory.It attempted to retrieve issue
  posts directly from GitHub by executing commands such as google and get_hyperlinks
  to gather data.'
