type: knowledge misalignment
case: '3'
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- godmode-gpt/autogpt/commands/file_operations.py/split_file()
trigger_tests:
- '1.Configure and start the app with the "local" memory backend.

  2.Create a small file (test_file_126.txt) with about 126 characters.

  3.Run data_ingestion on this file.

  4.Check auto-gpt.json. The file will exist but contain no data.

  5.Check console logs. They indicate: 0 chunks were saved (because the file is too
  small).

  6.Extend the file to about 1198 characters (test_file_1198.txt).

  7.Run data_ingestion again on the larger file.

  8.Check console logs. This time it indicates: 1 chunk was saved.

  9.Verify auto-gpt.json has been updated with ingested content.'
