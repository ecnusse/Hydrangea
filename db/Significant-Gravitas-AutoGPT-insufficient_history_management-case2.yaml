defect_id: Significant-Gravitas-AutoGPT-insufficient_history_management-case2
type: insufficient history management
case: '2'
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- scripts/main.py
trigger_tests:
- '1. Set up and Configure AutoGPT.

  2. Create a Task: Create a task for AutoGPT that is likely to fail or has complex
  steps prone to errors.

  3. Observe Task Execution: Run the task and let AutoGPT operate for an extended
  period. Check if it gets stuck in loops because it thinks failed repeated attempts
  are relevant and therefore should be tried again and again.

  4. Actual Result:

  Name: test

  Role: coder

  Goal: write a python file to print Hello, AutoGPT and execute it until success

  Observation: It failed to execute the python file and then fell into a loop of rewriting
  and re-executing the file repeatedly.'
