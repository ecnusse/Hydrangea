defect_id: catid-Supercharger-Auto-GPT-conflicting_knowledge_entries-/
type: conflicting knowledge entries
case: /
consequence:
- IC
- IS
locations:
- 'scripts/file_operations.py: write_to_file and append_to_file functions; scripts/commands.py:
  command execution'
trigger_tests:
- '1) Setup deps and OPENAI_API_KEY; 2) Test write_to_file function: correctly overwrites
  file content (expected behavior); 3) Test append_to_file function: correctly appends
  to file content (expected behavior); 4) Test mixed operations: write then append
  then write then append; 5) Observe proper behavior: write overwrites, append adds;
  6) Test memory operations: no interference with file operations; 7) Conclusion:
  File operations work correctly as designed; 8) Possible explanation: User may have
  expected append behavior but used write_to_file command.'
