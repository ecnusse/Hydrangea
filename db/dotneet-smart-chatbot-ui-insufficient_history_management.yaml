trigger_tests:
- '1. Set up Chatbot UI: Ensure the Chatbot UI project is correctly set up in your
  local environment. 2. Engage in a Conversation: Start a chat session and continue
  it for several interactions. 3. Observe Context Freezing: Notice that after a few
  exchanges, the dialogue context freezes, and responses to new queries remain the
  same. 4. Real test confirmed: Dialog context gets stuck when asking "What is artificial
  intelligence?" after previous conversation about backpropagation, system returns
  same response "Backpropagation is an algorithm..." indicating context freezing and
  state synchronization issues between conversation updates and stream processing.'
