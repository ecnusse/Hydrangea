  Give the prompt:

  Name: Xiaoji Tour Guide

  Role: Design a detailed 10-day tour plan for Xinjiang starting and ending in Urumqi,
  respond and search in Chinese.

  Goals: [''Respond in Chinese and use Chinese keywords for search'', ''Include detailed
  itinerary and budget'', ''Suitable for a trip in late July during summer vacation'',
  ''Relaxing with not too much traveling'', ''Suitable for car rental or self-driving'']


  According to the user''s logs, the next steps are as follows:

  THOUGHTS: I think we should start by searching for some popular tourist destinations
  in Xinjiang and then plan our itinerary accordingly. We can also look for some car
  rental services in the area.

  REASONING: By searching for popular tourist destinations, we can get an idea of
  what places are worth visiting and plan our itinerary accordingly. Additionally,
  by looking for car rental services, we can determine the feasibility of renting
  a car for the trip.

  PLAN:


  Search for popular tourist destinations in Xinjiang

  Look for car rental services in the area

  Plan itinerary based on the destinations found

  CRITICISM: I need to make sure that I am not just relying on the most popular tourist
  destinations and that I am considering other factors such as cost and time constraints.
