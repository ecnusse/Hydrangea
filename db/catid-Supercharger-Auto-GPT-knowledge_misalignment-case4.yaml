defect_id: catid-Supercharger-Auto-GPT-knowledge_misalignment-case4
type: knowledge misalignment
case: '4'
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- 'scripts/browse.py: split_text function'
trigger_tests:
- '1) Setup deps and OPENAI_API_KEY; 2) Create text with very small last paragraph;
  3) Test split_text() with max_length=1000; 4) Observe chunks: first empty (0 chars),
  middle large (5200 chars), last tiny (21 chars); 5) Test overlap processing with
  overlap_size=500; 6) Observe "overlap size (500) > last chunk size (21)" error;
  7) This indicates split_text() cannot handle overlap when last chunk is too small;
  8) May cause token overflow errors when processing large files.'
