  1. Enter the Chat Knowledge scenario.

  2. Upload "The Little Prince" .md knowledge file to the knowledge base.

  3. Ask:

  "What did the Little Prince learn from the fox?"

  "What lesson does the dialogue between the Little Prince and the fox teach us?"

  "What is the most important lesson the fox taught the Little Prince?"

  Log observation: The log redundancy mainly outputs request retries, HTTP connection
  status, and JSON parsing details, causing console overload and making it hard to
  spot critical errors.'
