- autogpt/commands/file_operations.py/split_file()
trigger_tests:
- "1. Complete the environment setup for the app.\n2. Run AutoGPT (`python -m autogpt`)\
  \ and prompt it to read a file `testfile.txt` (file should be reasonably large).\n\
  3. AI Configuration:\nAI Name: File-Reader-GPT\nAI Role: An AI assistant designed\
  \ to read large text files and summarize their contents.\nGoal 1: Read the file\
  \ `testfile.txt`.\nGoal 2: Summarize the contents of the file.\n4. Authorize the\
  \ AI to read the file and observe its behavior.\n5. Observed Behavior:\n   (1) AutoGPT\
  \ repeatedly attempts to read the file in different ways (line by line, chunked\
  \ reading, skimming).\n   (2) Each attempt fails, showing \"The JSON object is invalid.\"\
  \ in the logs.\n   (3) AutoGPT never successfully summarizes the file.\n6. Defect\
  \ Description: The app cannot handle reading large files properly"
