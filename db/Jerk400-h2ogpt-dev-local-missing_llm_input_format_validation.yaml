defect_id: Jerk400-h2ogpt-dev-local-missing_llm_input_format_validation-/
type: Missing LLM input format validation
case: /
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- src/gpt_langchain.py:UnstructuredPowerPointLoader; models/modelling_RW_falcon7b.py
trigger_tests:
- 1. Start the h2oGPT application; 2. Upload a PPTX file with complex formatting,
  embedded objects, or corrupted content; 3. Observe that the system processes the
  file without format validation; 4. Check that embedded objects (charts, images)
  are ignored or not properly extracted; 5. Verify that large PPT files are processed
  inefficiently without optimization; 6. Confirm that corrupted PPT files may cause
  crashes or incorrect results; 7. Observe that the system lacks PPT-specific content
  structure optimization
