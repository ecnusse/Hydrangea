case: '2'
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- client/src/service/moduleDispatch/kb/search.ts;client/src/pages/api/openapi/kb/searchTest.ts
trigger_tests:
- '1. Import the knowledge base with serial number/model data; 2. We have tried Q&A
  training and document uploading to the knowledge base to ensure that the numbered
  keywords have been covered by the knowledge base multiple times; 3. Neither semantic
  retrieval nor full-text retrieval can accurately point to the relevant knowledge;
  4. VERIFIED: System lacks number-specific processing in vector search, causing imprecise
  knowledge retrieval for numeric queries'
