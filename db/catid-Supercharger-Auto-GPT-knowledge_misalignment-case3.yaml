defect_id: catid-Supercharger-Auto-GPT-knowledge_misalignment-case3
type: knowledge misalignment
case: '3'
consequence:
- IC
locations:
- 'scripts/browse.py: split_text function; scripts/commands.py: commit_memory; scripts/memory.py:
  memory storage'
trigger_tests:
- '1) Setup deps and OPENAI_API_KEY; 2) Create file with exactly 126 characters; 3)
  Test split_text() with max_length=100; 4) Observe 2 chunks: first empty (0 chars),
  second with content (126 chars); 5) Simulate data ingestion: only 1 valid chunk
  saved to memory; 6) Create file with 1198 characters; 7) Observe same issue: 1 chunk
  saved instead of proper chunking; 8) This indicates split_text() logic error affects
  data ingestion.'
