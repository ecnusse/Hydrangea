locations:
- utils/app/clean.ts, agent/agentUtil.ts, pages/api/home/home.tsx, components/Chat/ChatInput.tsx,
  hooks/chatmode/useDirectMode.ts
trigger_tests:
- '1. Start chatting. 2. Type a new prompt while the chatbot is generating an answer
  to a previous one. 3. When the previous answer finishes generating, the new prompt
  in the chat bar disappears and the chat bar refreshes. You will lose the contents
  that you have typed so far and need to start the process again. 4. Test case: Try
  to select a prompt template while typing in the chat input to observe content interference.
  5. Test case: Trigger an error during message generation to observe input content
  loss during error handling.'
