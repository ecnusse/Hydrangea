defect_id: REFRIED-BoolEANS-privatgpt-gui-resource_contention-case1
type: resource contention
case: '1'
consequence:
- SL
locations:
- privateGPT.py
- ingest.py
trigger_tests:
- 'Ensure PrivateGPT is set up and the server is running.

  Open the privateGPT.py file.

  Set the n_threads parameter to a high value, such as n_threads=40, to use all CPU
  cores.

  Save the changes.

  Restart the PrivateGPT server.

  Observe the server''s performance and note if there is a drastic slowdown or significant
  delay in response times when answering questions.

  Additional Steps:


  Try setting n_threads=1 to use only 1 CPU core and observe if the performance issue
  persists.

  Remove the n_threads parameter entirely from the privateGPT.py file and check if
  the answer speed improves and returns to normal.'
