defect_id: EmbraceAGI-LocalAGI-absence_of_final_output-case3
type: absence of final output
case: '3'
consequence:
- UI
locations:
- local_agi.py:515-525 (task parsing logic), local_agi.py:620-680 (main function)
trigger_tests:
- "1. Set up LocalAGI according to the README.md of this project: https://github.com/EmbraceAGI/LocalAGI/blob/main/README.md\
  \ \n2. Set environment variables:\n   LLM_MODEL=chatglm-6b\n   OBJECTIVE=Write a\
  \ hello world program\n   INITIAL_TASK=Create the main function\n3. Run the program\
  \ with: python local_agi.py\n4. When the LLM responds with malformed output like\
  \ 'The objective is complete' or 'No more tasks needed', the program will continue\
  \ executing remaining tasks without recognizing that the objective has been achieved."
