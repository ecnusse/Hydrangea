- SL
locations:

trigger_tests:
- 1. Upload spreadsheet files to your knowledge base. 2. Select "Direct Segmentation".
  3. Review the segmentation results and observe that segmentation is done directly
  by word count. For example, when chunking an EXCEL spreadsheet file, the text is
  truncated directly by word count, resulting in information from the same row being
  located in different chunks.
