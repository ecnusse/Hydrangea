defect_id: dotneet-smart-chatbot-ui-exceeding_llm_content_limit-case4
type: exceeding LLM content limit
case: '4'
consequence:
- SL
locations:
- types/llmUsage.ts, components/Chat/ChatInputTokenCount.tsx, components/Chat/ChatMessage.tsx,
  components/Markdown/MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx, pages/api/chat.ts
trigger_tests:
- '1. Set up Chatbot UI: Ensure the Chatbot UI project is correctly set up in your
  local environment. 2. Engage in Long Text Generation: Initiate a conversation or
  code generation that results in lengthy texts. 3. Observe Performance: During the
  generation of long texts, notice slowdowns and freezes in the UI. The speed should
  return to normal after the process completes or is interrupted. 4. Real test confirmed:
  UI blocking operations during token counting and markdown rendering, high memory
  usage with large texts (500KB text caused 7907KB memory increase), and main thread
  blocking causing UI freezes and slowdowns.'
